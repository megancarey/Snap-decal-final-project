# Snap-decal-final-project
In Snap!, you are able to create a customized sprite icon by using a built-in paint menu. The paint menu available lacks a text-blurb option, so we were hoping to add that as a feature. With this feature, you would be able to add a text box over the object. The paint menu currently has 8 boxes that each correspond to a different editing option (for example, drawing a circle or filling in the box). One of the boxes is just a bulls-eye that demonstrates where the center of the sprite will be. We hope to make the bulls-eye an on/off option, like a checkbox, outside of the 8-item menu. We will add the text editing option in its place. Please email mcarey@berkeley.edu if you need clarification!

Members for this project: Megan Carey, Liza Praprotnik, and Bao Xie.
